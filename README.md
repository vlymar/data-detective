# Data Detective README

I used this project to learn Scala and experiment with some of the functional programming techniques in [https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). 

### Overview
Given a large collection of JSON documents, Data Detective efficiently generates a schema and aggregate statistics over the data. The goal is to be able to run data detective on n machines/sets of documents and then aggregate the intermediate results. 

Although I did use data detective while building an ETL system at Scribd for a [large set of court document metadata](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/), it is more of a personal learning project than a production ready tool. There are most certainly bugs present. The output is raw and not easily human readable (yet).

### Usage
Note: these are temporary instructions. From the repo directory:

`sbt run datadir/ out.txt
`
### Algorithm

Data Detective (DD) accepts a directory as an argument. It then builds a stream of the files in the directory and lazily does the following:
1. parses the JSON in each file
2. converts the parsed JSON into an intermediate data structure (`ValueAggregate`) that represents the schema and statistics of that JSON file.
3. merges the aggregations together.
4. Serializes the aggregation to JSON and prints it.

The intermediate representation is designed to take up constant space\*, and to be mergeable with other intermediate representations generated by separate processes. This allows the algorithm to be parallelizable.

\* Its a while since I've been in school, so this is not _totally_ accurate. The intermediate representation actually scales with the size of the overall schema of the dataset. This is negligible relative to the size of the dataset itself though, unless your schema is huge and your dataset is tiny :)

### Example
TODO

### Alternatives
The incredible [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). jq doesn't quite do the same thing as data-detective but you can use it to achieve the same ends, probably more correctly :)
