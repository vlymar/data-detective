# Data Detective

I used this project to learn Scala and experiment with some of the functional programming techniques in https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala.

### Overview
Given a large collection of JSON documents, Data Detective efficiently generates a schema and aggregate statistics over the data.

### Usage
Note: these are temporary instructions. From the repo directory:

`sbt run data_dir/ out.txt`
